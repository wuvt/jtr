jtr, or "jack the ripper", wuvt's theoretical CD ripping cluster management tool

rip-client.sh can be run standalone or as part of the cluster; it relies on
common utils (which, curl, dc, eject) and a recent version of
[whipper](https://github.com/whipper-team/whipper). Read the code; there
are a couple environmental variables you'll want to pass in. It does some nasty 
parsing of the STDOUT/STDERR of whipper, which is not a stable interface. Current
code relies on 0.9.0. the older 0.8.x series sends more info to STDOUT and less
to STDERR, which breaks the percentage completion estimation.

The web server side will eventually store info to a DB with relevant metadata to
be able to find CDs again. we're assigning a numeric barcode to every CD to help
with this (and maybe make some things more automatic in the future).
